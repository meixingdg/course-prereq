ARCH_2110	Fall	2015	The Building and Thinking of Architecture 1	2110	This course addresses the history of architectural and related developments in selected Western and non-Western civilizations to construct a conceptual and strategic understanding of the relationships between architecture, geography, culture, technology, and thought.	0	4		4	None	Architecture	ARCH
ARCH_2120	Fall	2015	The Building and Thinking of Architecture 2	2120	This course expands upon notions introduced in ARCH 2110 that architecture is a practice embedded in human cultures characterized by particular ways of thinking in action. In addition, notions that its domain of interests, physically and intellectually, extends beyond the limits of individual buildings are elaborated through specific examples. This is done against the background of the major shift in intellectual developments beginning in the 17th century that provide stimulus for the scientific, cultural, technological, and social revolutions of the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. Unlike ARCH 2110, this course for the most part, does not proceed in a chronological fashion.	0	2		2	Prerequisite: ARCH 2110.	Architecture	ARCH
ARCH_2130	Fall	2015	Contemporary Design Approaches	2130	Contemporary practices in architecture are examined and used as foils in order to better understand one’s own individual approach to design. The point is to help uncover some of the self-evidently “true” presuppositions that we all make when we design. By knowing what we take for granted and knowing also that others work with presuppositions which may be substantively different from our own, we begin to realize both our ability to exercise choices and our responsibility to think through the consequences of those choices. Each of the approaches is explored as to its ontological, epistemological, value, and methodological presuppositions. Two very direct questions help in this reflection: What relation does the given approach have to the formative conditions of the contemporary city? and, How does each of the design approaches relate to the American experiences in thought and action?	0	2		2	Prerequisite: ARCH 2120.

An essential part of this course is to stimulate students’ curiosity about architecture and the larger world and introduce them to key issues of architecture regarding space, form, critique, technology, aesthetics, societal and cultural contexts, etc. Crucial to this goal is to encourage students to pursue and develop their own unique vision and voice in architecture throughout their education and practice. Fundamental to this process is making students aware of the necessity to challenge their own subjectivities, biases, and presuppositions.	0	2		2	ARCH 2160 Architectural Media.	Architecture	ARCH
ARCH_2160	Fall	2015	Architectural Media	2160	This course continues the inquiry begun in ARCH 2150 The Ethos of Architecture and focuses especially on the implications that various media and means of representation have on the breadth of concerns within the history, theory, and critical practices of architecture and especially the generation of architecture.	0	2		2	ARCH 4090 Architectural Case Studies	Architecture	ARCH

ARCH_2330	Fall	2015	Structures 1	2330	Introduction to Structures introduces the student of Architecture to the principles of structural mechanics and their application to basic architectural structures comprised primarily of wood. The fundamentals of statics are presented in order to gain an understanding of the way in which external forces produce internal stresses in individual members and, in essence, flow through the building system to be resolved at the foundation level. The principles of strength of materials are studied to understand how particular structural materials and configurations manage to resist these forces without unacceptable distortions, or even failure. Wood structural properties are studied in all their complexity as a means to internalize the more theoretical topics broached. Through in-class presentations, reading, homework and project work, computer lab, field trips, and case studies, the student will be aided in developing this intuitive (while practical) understanding. It is recognized that intuitions of building technologies are not acquired quickly but result from much study, observation, and practice. Introduction to Structures makes use of the several approaches above to ensure that the beginning student is provided with a broad, solid base for future structural investigations. WebCT will be used to expand the student’s access to course materials and allow for a measure of distance learning. Sustainability: The following notions are introduced as important attributes of sustainable structures and construction: durability and service life, and life cycle cost.	0	4		4	Prerequisite: ARCH 2510 except M.Arch students.

ARCH_2350	Fall	2015	Construction Systems	2350	Construction Systems centers on the development of a technical knowledge of, sensibility to, and intuition for the process by which an architectural design is realized in built form. The interdependence among building materials, acoustic qualities, enclosure systems, interior, finish, and other systems is investigated, with an emphasis on the broader architectural design endeavor. Drawing as a means of understanding forms the basis for a semester-long project to be done in small groups. Case studies will center on concepts and systems that have not yet found their way into mainstream practice. The course approach will involve in-class presentations, project work, field trips and case studies. WebCT will be used to expand the student’s access to course materials and allow for a measure of distance learning. Sustainability: The notion that design intentions can be nullified through incorrect construction is stressed. The importance of proper detailing, construction, and maintenance to accomplish lasting and efficient enclosures is highlighted. Skills to diagnose and treat incorrect construction are developed.	0	2		2	Prerequisite: ARCH 2510 except M.Arch. students.	Architecture	ARCH
ARCH_2360	Fall	2015	Environmental and Ecological Systems	2360	An exploration of the fundamental principles of human physiology, thermal and luminous comfort, and indoor quality. Emphasis is on bioclimatic and psychrometric climate analysis and its relationship to architectural design, understanding the energy exchange between body in space, the natural meaning of enclosures, and nonstructural materials and systems. The focus is on passive heating, cooling, and daylighting systems and their design. Exercises include vital sign analysis of existing spaces (thermal, air, luminous), forming hypotheses of building performance, using scientific instrumentation, tenant survey techniques, and physical modeling and simulation techniques related to daylighting and shading techniques.	0	4		4	Prerequisites: PHYS 1500, ARCH 2820 or permission of instructor.

ARCH_2510	Fall	2015	Materials and Design	2510	This course establishes an understanding of the most common materials, their properties and resulting uses, and the implications of their uses in the larger context of material life cycles. The structural makeup of metals, ceramics, polymers, and composite materials is discovered and their resulting properties, costs, and life cycle consequences are clarified. An understanding of basic mechanical properties is established hands on by conducting tension, compression, and 3-point bending tests (mse-lab). Physical performance of material constructs as synergy between form and material properties is further illustrated. Experiments are conducted that introduce such major concepts as structural loading, properties of sections, and resulting system performance. Sustainability: The concept of life cycles is introduced; material and energy flows are tracked throughout the entire material life cycle. This will be accomplished alongside introducing major material groupings (metals, polymers, ceramics, and composites). Students come to realize that environmental concerns are directly related to structural composition and material availability. Consequences of resource extraction, distribution, manipulation, use, and disposal, reuse or recycle are addressed at both local and global scales. Selected field trips to materials extraction, processing, manufacturing, disposal, and recycling facilities are aimed to give physical meaning to the concept of life cycle.	0	2		2	None	Architecture	ARCH

ARCH_4070	Fall	2015	Twisted Siblings:Relationships Between Contemporary Painting and Digital Architecture	4070	Architecture and painting are two of the oldest forms of societal expression and have been historically linked in complex and dynamic ways. In the 20th century, the movements of Cubism, Futurism, Neo-Plasticism, Constructivism, Purism, Surrealism and Dadaism consisted of dynamic dialogs between architecture and painting. These exchanges allowed each to have a profound and deep impact upon the other. By contrast, in early 21st century, there seems to be all but a mute relationship between the two. This course intends to help break that silence. This course will begin to bridge the divide by establishing new connections between the current preoccupations with materials, procedures, and affects that are emerging in both, contemporary painting and architecture. Twisted Siblings seeks to explore and discover new relationships between the most cutting-edge digital technologies and how painting may influence the expressive capacities of these technologies. As contemporary painting and architecture seek to establish future directions, a new dialog and exchange of ideas should be emerging, to ensure a dynamic and radical future for both. The course will consist of a series of lectures, discussions and presentations. Students will be expected to research a number of individual architects, painters, and writers who are producing work of related interest. Students will be responsible for completing a research project, which synthesizes the content of the course.	0	2		2	None	Architecture	ARCH
